My portfolio app is built in ReactJs. It allows a user to easily navigate from page to page with the nav bar using an npm package called router. The home page is the about me section with a description of me and a photo. Along with those I have added clickable image links that will take a user directly to my instagram page, github profile, linkedIn account and my resume which loads a google doc. The portfolio page has six screenshots and descriptions of some of my favorite projects I have created. A github link and a link to the deployed project is also available within each card component. Lastly I added a contact page which alows a user to in thoery send me an email with any questions or comments that need a response.
